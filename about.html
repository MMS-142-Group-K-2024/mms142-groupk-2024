        <p> Disruptive technologies are reshaping industries and redefining how consumers and businesses operate. Unlike sustaining innovations that merely enhance existing systems, disruptive innovations revolutionize markets by creating entirely new models and opportunities. </p>
        <p> As Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen (1997) explained in his book The Innovator's Dilemma, "these technologies disrupt established industries by introducing simpler, more accessible, and often more affordable alternatives" (p. 15). Over time, they evolve and surpass traditional methods, as seen in the transformation from film photography to digital photography (Abusamra, 2019). </p>
        <p> In the Philippines, these advancements bring undeniable benefits, such as increased productivity, expanded market access for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and economic growth. However, the adoption of disruptive technologies also presents challenges. Many businesses, particularly in rural areas, face difficulties in implementing new systems due to limited digital literacy, inadequate infrastructure, and financial constraints. Even disruptive technologies encounter resistance or setbacks when strategies are poorly executed or resources are lacking. </p>
        <p> One of the most impactful applications of disruptive technology in the Philippines is in the agriculture sector critical to the nationâ€™s economy and food security, known as AgriTech. It is changing the way the agricultural sector operates, addressing inefficiencies and introducing sustainable practices to ensure resilient food systems. Innovations like direct-to-consumer platforms and precision farming tools empower Filipino farmers to tackle challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and market accessibility. These technologies transcend mere innovation, dismantling outdated agricultural practices and paving the way for a future defined by efficiency, sustainability, and equity. </p>
