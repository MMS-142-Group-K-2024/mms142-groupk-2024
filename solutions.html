        <h2>The Use of AgriTech to Overcome Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), in partnership with SL AgriTech Corporation (SLAC), introduced Hybrid Rice Technology in 2018 to address critical challenges in Philippine agriculture. This innovation aims to boost rice production and contribute to the country’s goal of achieving rice self-sufficiency. The initiative responds to the increasing global demand for rice, driven by factors such as rapid population growth, the impacts of climate change, and the need for sustainable food production (IRRI, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Building on these efforts, the D4AgPH platform was also launched through a collaboration between IRRI and the Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR). Set to significantly enhance rice production in 2024, this platform provides Digital Agriculture Tools and Services (DATS), including real-time monitoring, precision farming recommendations, and resource optimization strategies. These tools equip farmers with the technology to improve resource management, mitigate the effects of climate change, and overcome technological limitations (IRRI, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
            Early adopters have reported yield increases of up to 15% and a reduction in irrigation water usage by 10%. Despite these successes, challenges remain, such as limited digital literacy among rural farmers and inadequate infrastructure in remote areas. Addressing these barriers will require ongoing training programs, better access to financing, and public-private partnerships.

        <h2>AgriTech as Disruptive Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Agricultural technology, or AgriTech, refers to the application of technological advancements in farming and agriculture. According to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (n.d.), AgriTech encompasses tools such as sensors, drones, artificial intelligence, and information technology to improve farming practices. These innovations create an industry that is more efficient, sustainable, and data-driven, addressing critical challenges like food security, resource scarcity, and climate change.
