    </header>
    <section>
        <p>
            Agriculture has long been the backbone of the Philippine economy, playing a critical role in food production and security. However, the sector faces significant challenges, including climate change, natural and man-made crises, population growth, and limitations in land and technology. Key crops such as rice, sugarcane, corn, and mangoes are increasingly vulnerable, resulting in declining productivity, rising food prices, and weakened food security. In response, AgriTech innovations have emerged as a disruptive force, offering tools to address these challenges and prepare for a global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 ("Everything You Need to Know About Agritech," 2022).

                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p>
                    Unpredictable weather patterns, such as floods, droughts, and typhoons, reduce crop yields and disrupt planting cycles, making farming more uncertain and less productive.

                <h3>Natural and Manmade Crises</h3>
                <p>
                    Natural events like the COVID-19 pandemic and outbreaks such as African Swine Fever (ASF) significantly disrupt agricultural production, causing labor shortages and affecting livestock and crop yields. Policies like rice tariffication and international conflicts, such as the Ukraine-Russia war, affect food supply chains and agricultural markets.

                <h3>Population Growth and Increased Crop Demand</h3>
                <p>
                    As the population grows, there is a higher demand for food, putting pressure on the agricultural sector to produce more. This increases the strain on land and resources, leading to potential overuse and reduced productivity over time.

                <h3>Technological Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Many farmers lack access to modern farming technologies and equipment, hindering their ability to improve yields, manage resources efficiently, and adapt to changing conditions. This limits their potential for growth and innovation in the sector.

                        Climate change and the unpredictable weather patterns such as floods and droughts, reduce the crop yields. Inconsistent rainfall or excessive flooding can lead to crop failure and decrease overall productivity, particularly in rice production.

                        Many farmers face poverty due to unstable incomes from unpredictable harvests. The lack of access to advanced technology and financial support limits their ability to improve productivity, leaving them trapped in a cycle of poverty.

                        Reduced crop yields and rising production costs lead to higher food prices. As the supply of key crops like rice and corn shrinks, prices increase, making food less affordable for many Filipinos.

                        Lower crop productivity and higher food prices undermine food security. The Philippines struggles to ensure an adequate and affordable food supply, particularly in rural areas, leaving it vulnerable to shortages.

                        As local production falls short, the Philippines relies more on imported goods to meet demand. This increases vulnerability to global market fluctuations and trade disruptions, further jeopardizing food security.
