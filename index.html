            Agriculture in the Philippines faces persistent challenges, including climate change, inefficiencies in distribution, and market accessibility barriers. This report focuses on the disruptive impact of AgriTech platforms, emphasizing how they fundamentally transform the agricultural landscape by redefining traditional supply chains and market dynamics. Disruptive innovations in AgriTech provide new opportunities for Filipino farmers, enabling them to access markets more directly, reduce reliance on intermediaries, and adopt more efficient practices. Case studies illustrate how these technologies disrupt entrenched systems by offering affordable, scalable, and user-friendly solutions tailored to the unique needs of farmers. While highlighting economic, social, and technological impacts, the study also explores the barriers to adoption and inclusion faced by marginalized communities. Through a structured analysis, this research underscores the transformative potential of disruptive AgriTech platforms in driving sustainable and equitable growth in the Philippine agricultural sector.
